# ALX Listing App

## Project Description
The **ALX Listing App** is an Airbnb clone listing page built using **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**. The goal of this project is to create a responsive, user-friendly interface for listing properties, with reusable components for a seamless user experience.

## Project Structure

- **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components such as `Card` and `Button`. These components are used throughout the app to display information and handle user interactions.
- **`interfaces/`**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for the props that each component accepts. These interfaces ensure type safety across the project.
- **`constants/`**: Stores reusable data or strings such as API URLs, configuration settings, or UI text, making it easier to manage and update the project.
- **`public/assets/`**: Holds static assets like images or icons used in the app.
